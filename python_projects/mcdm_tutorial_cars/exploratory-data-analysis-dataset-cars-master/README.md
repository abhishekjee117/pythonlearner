## Exploratory data analysis

We have two small csv files that describe some characteristics of vehicles. 
In cars_multi.csv we have the columns:

* ID
* mpg
* cylinders
* displacement
* horsepower
* weight
* acceleration
* model
* origin
* car_name

In the cars_price.csv we have the columns: 

* ID
* price

My task is to understand how the data in these columns relate to each other, to uncover interesting things, and to communicate those findings. I'm going to focus on the correlation between mpg and the other properties.
